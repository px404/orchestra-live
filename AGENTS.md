## Orchestra architecture rules

- Routing is TanStack Router (file-based in `src/routes/`); React Router cannot be installed on this stack, so section 10's routes, `?task=` drawer and `?next=` login redirect are implemented with it.
- Every network call goes through `src/lib/api.ts`; no component calls `fetch` directly, so token, error shape, 401 handling and mock switching stay in one place.
- `src/lib/mock.ts` is a full in-memory backend keyed by the same paths and query filters as the real API, so mock and live differ only in transport.
- Shared query options with polling intervals live in `src/lib/queries.ts` so every screen polls consistently (2s pages, 5s graph) and keeps previous data.
- No backend integrations (Cloud/Supabase/auth providers): the app is frontend-only against an external Express API.
